# Government

Democracy begins with the first elected government assemblies: Nova Scotia in 1758, P.E.I. in 1773, New Brunswick in 1785.

Canada is a:

1. Federal state, with 3 levels of governments.
2. Constitutional monarchy: the Queen is head of state but only has symbolic powers. The PM is the head of the government.
3. Parliamentary democracy: leaders are elected and they obey the people.

3 levels of government:

1. Federal: makes laws for national defense, foreign policy, finance, interprovincial trade and communication, currency, navigation, criminal law and citizenship.
2. Provincial: makes laws for education, healthcare, natural resources, highways, policing, etc. Made up of 87 MLAs (in BC).
3. Municipal: makes by-laws for garbage collection, firefighters, snowplowing, libraries, sewers, construction, etc. Made up of the mayor and the city council.

The shared responsibilities of the federal and provincial governments are agriculture, immigration, and environment.

The Governor General (currently Mary Simon) is the representation of the Queen. Appointed by the PM, she signs bills and performs symbolic duties. Her term lasts 5 years.

Each province has a Lieutenant General, with a similar role to the Governor General; and a Premier, with a similar role to the PM (it's called Commissioner in the territories).

The PM selects the [Cabinet](https://pm.gc.ca/en/cabinet) (~40 people) from the House of Commons. They run federal departments, prepare the budget and prepare new laws.

3 branches of government:

1. Executive (PM, Cabinet). Execute laws.
2. Legislative (Sovereign, the Senate and the House of Commons). Makes laws.
3. Judicial (Supreme Court). Enforce laws.

Parliament has 3 parts:

1. the Sovereign, who is represented  by the Governor General
2. the Senate, which is made of 105 Senators appointed on the Prime Minister’s recommendation and who are in their role up until their 75th birthday
3. the House of Commons, made up of 308 MPs elected by voters. In the House of Commons, there are Government Members and Opposition Members (those from the party with the 2nd most votes).

How laws are made: bills are proposed by Cabinet -> approved by House of Commons -> approved by the Senate -> approved by Governor General -> law.

1. First reading: the bill is printed and considered read
2. Second reading: members debate the bill's principle
3. Committee stage: committee members study the bill clause by clause
4. Report stage: members can make amendments
5. Third reading: members debate and vote on the bill
6. Senate
7. Royal assent: the bill passes both houses

# Justice

Sources of law:
- Parliament
- Provincial legislatures
- English common law
- France's civil code
- Unwritten constitution from UK

_Habeas corpus_, the right to challenge unlawful detention by the state, comes from English common law.

_Presumption of innocence_: everyone is innocent until proven otherwise.

_Due process_: the government must respect all the legal rights a person is entitled to.

The Judiciary branch is made up of the Supreme Court, which consists of 9 judges appointed by the Governor General. They are there until their 75th birthday and can throw out laws that they deem violate freedoms. Below the Supreme Court are the Federal Court and the Provincial Courts. These include appeal courts, trial courts, and other courts (family, traffic, etc).

The Court settles disputes. The police keeps people safe and enforces laws.

# Elections

The country is divided into 308 electoral districts or _ridings_ or _constituencies_.

Canadian citizens over 18 years old and who registered in the National Register of Electors (can be added even on the election day) pick MPs for the House of Commons. They receive an election card saying when and where to vote.

The party that wins the most seats, wins. The leader of that party becomes the Prime Minister.

The party that wins becomes a majority government if they have more than half the seats. If they don't, they become a minority government. They keep running until they lose the confidence of the majority of the MPs. If a majority of the MPs vote against a major government decision, the party in power is defeated and the PM asks the Governor General to call for an election.

Elections happen every 4 years. Vote is secret.
